# DeepLearning

Some Deep Learning things.

## Datasets

All used datasets are under "DeepLearning/datasets" folder, but in the scripts they are referenced as they were on the same directory as the script. This is for sake of repo organization. Of course, to make they work, if you download/clone the repo, just take the data file into the same directory as the script you're trying to run.

## Overview

### GensimBasics

Basic simple example of use of Gensim for Word2Vec.

### KerasBasics

Basic example of use of Keras for Time Series prediction.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

The core of the repo. Time Series and NLP problems solved with RNN via Tensorflow.

### TFLearnBasics

Basic simple example of use of Gensim for Sentiment Analysis.

### TensorFlowBasics

Demonstrations of how some of the Tensorflow's basics functions works. Also some basic task like a classification task in TF.

### Utils

Like-Libraries and util stuff.

### datasets
